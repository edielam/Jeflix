# Jeflix - A Full Stack Clone of Netflix Web Application

Jeflix is a comprehensive project that aims to replicate the functionality and design of the popular streaming platform Netflix. It is built using a range of technologies, including React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, and Nginx Web Server.

The project encompasses both the frontend and backend components necessary to create a fully functional streaming platform. The frontend is developed using React, a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a seamless and intuitive user experience, mirroring the design and features of the original Netflix application.

On the backend, Node.js and Express.js are utilized to create a robust and scalable server that handles user requests, manages authentication, and serves data to the frontend. The project also incorporates MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based database service, for efficient storage and retrieval of user profiles, preferences, and content metadata.

To ensure optimal performance and security, the project utilizes the Nginx web server, which acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Nginx helps in efficiently handling incoming requests and distributing them across multiple backend servers, resulting in improved responsiveness and scalability.

**Note: Jeflix is a clone project created for educational purposes and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Netflix.**
